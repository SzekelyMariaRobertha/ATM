# ATM

This project represents the code support needed for implementing an ATM, more precisely what happens behind an ATM .
The code is written in VHDL and you can follow the execution using Vivado simulation waveform.

## Requirements
Vivado: 2016.4 

## Usage

To follow the execution of the program, it is necessary for the user to provide different values to the signals in order to observe varied results. For more details on using the vivado simulation waveform, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb5LRi5scMw.

VHDL allows for the creation of a simulation environment that can be used to test the functionality of the ATM design before it is implemented in hardware. This can help identify and correct errors early in the design process.

Overall, having a bank (ATM) implementation in VHDL can help ensure that the design meets the system requirements, operates correctly, and can be customized as needed.
